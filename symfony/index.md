Symfony is an open source, [PHP project](/php) started in 2005 by [Fabien Potencier](http://fabien.potencier.org/). Its current version, **Symfony2**, is a collection of beautifully architectured, [cutting edge components](http://symfony.com/components).

The component approach not only creates powerful and flexible software but also enabled easy integration, which has lead to wide adoption in other major PHP projects. Such as phpBB, Silex, [Drupal](/drupal), Behat, FLOW3, PHPUnit and Doctrine2, just to namedrop a few that now *builds upon Symfony2*.

In this new era of PHP renaissance, the Symfony project is not only ahead of the curve, it leads it.
