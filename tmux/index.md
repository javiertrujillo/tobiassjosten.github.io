When doing [software development](/development) I practically *live in my terminal*. I believe a well configured CLI trumps its GUI counterpart and day of the week.

One tool I could not take this stance without is **tmux**, an open source [terminal multiplexer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer). It enables me to have several open *session windows* in the same terminal and to split those windows into *panes*.
