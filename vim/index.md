Vim is an advanced text editor for highly efficient programmers. It is very configurable and can serve as anything from a lightweight, note taking editor to an all-inclusive IDE.

I have been using *Vim* myself since 2011 and I feel I have really found my way home. Vim is an editor I can grow old with!
