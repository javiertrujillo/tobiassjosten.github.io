I just got home from a very nice [memcpy](http://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Software-Craftsmanship/events/67240142/) meetup, organized by [Gianfranco Alongi](https://twitter.com/gfalongi) and hosted by [Patrik Stenmark](https://github.com/spatrik) of [Valtech](http://www.valtech.se/). Thanks a lot for making this happen!

The core idea of the meetup was to share knowledge by pair programming. I know [Vim](/vim) and my partner, *Gianfranco*, certainly know [functional programming](http://erlcode.wordpress.com/). Together we hacked together a [Haskell](/haskell) program in Vim; simple enough for me to get the hang of the language but varied enough so Gianfranco could learn some Vim tricks.

We did so [ping pong style](http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activities/ping-pong), where one of us would start by writing a test and the other would make that test pass, before writing a test himself. I really liked that approach.

And I definitely hope to see more of these events!
