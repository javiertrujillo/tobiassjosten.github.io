I am just now headed for [Symfony Live 2012 Paris](http://paris2012.live.symfony.com/). This will be my first *Symfony Live* conference and I am really excited about it!

Previously I have been to two [Symfony Day events](/symfony/symfony-day-2011) and even organized a [Symfony2 workshop](/symfony/symfony-workshop-for-aspiring-hackers) together with others from [Symfony Sweden](http://www.symfony.se/). Symfony Live is more like the main event of our Symfony community however, which is why I am even braving a man cold to go there.

The official hash tag for this event is [#symfony_live](https://twitter.com/search/%23symfony_live) but I have also put together a [list of the attendees](https://twitter.com/tobiassjosten/symfony-live-2012-paris). Am I missing someone? Let me know!
