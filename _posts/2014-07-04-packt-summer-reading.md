Finally it's summer in the northern hemisphere! Though for us living in Scotland it's more like not-so-much-winter-anymore than actual summer. But still, many of us go on a well deserved vacation this time of year.

Stepping away from the computer for a longer period of time is a great thing. But that doesn't mean you have to stop tuning your skills and sharpening your tools. On the contrary, this is the perfect opportunity to delve deep into books and indulge in our thirst for knowledge.

As it happens this coincides with the tenth anniversary of my friends [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/), which they celebrate with having a sale on all their eBooks and videos. They are just $10 each — that's 0.29% of [a course on COBOL programming](http://www.hotcourses.com/uk-courses/Effective-Programming-with-COBOL-courses/page_pls_user_course_details/16180339/0/w/26425596/page.htm)!

I get two free books for promoting this but even so, I'll definitely load my Kindle up with a couple more than that. My list will probably be something like this:

- Social Media Mining with R

- Building Machine Learning Systems with Python

- RESTful PHP Web Services

- Elasticsearch Server: Second Edition

- Mastering Web Application Development with AngularJS

- Dependency Injection with AngularJS

Sounds good? Head on over to [Packt Publishing — 10 Years $10](http://www.packtpub.com/10years?utm_source=Packt10&utm_medium=tobiassjosten.net&utm_campaign=Packt10) and get yours before it ends on Saturday night!
