[Datormagazin](http://www.datormagazin.se/) is one of Sweden's major technology magazines. I have been reading it myself since back in 1997, when it was still called [PC+](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_plus). This [current November issue](http://www.datormagazin.se/tidningar/datormagazin/36) is special though – because it features my first published article!

The article is about getting started using [Symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/) by building a blog. I walk the user through downloading the framework, setting up an environment and starting to hash out the models, applications and modules. It is a lot to squeeze into four pages but all in all I am very pleased with how it turned out.

Let us hope this will help burst the Swedish traffic to [symfony-project.org](http://www.symfony-project.org/)!
