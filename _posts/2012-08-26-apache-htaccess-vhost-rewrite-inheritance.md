We all know hacking core is bad but code duplication is also irky and we do not want to miss future updates to `.htaccess` when upgrading.

Currently when you want to affect the way requests are routed into [Drupal](/drupal), you have two choices; either you hack the core `.htaccess` or you move all its content into your virtual host. We all know [hacking core is bad](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hagengraf/2802915470/) but code duplication is also irky and we do not want to miss future updates to `.htaccess` when upgrading.

This dilemma is not an edge case. Just installing [robotstxt.module](http://drupal.org/project/robotstxt) requires this kind of functionality, not to mention if you have moved from another system to Drupal and want to handle old URLs.

So it looks like a choice between plague and cholera. But actually, there is quite an elegant solution to our problem â€” *rewrite inheritance*.

## Rewrite inheritance

Using rewrite inheritance is not a new concept to Drupal; it is even recommended in the [Multisite Install & Configuration guide](http://drupal.org/node/138889). However, the way it is applied only lets the vhost inherit configuration from the main server. Our `.htaccess` will still come in and ruin everything.

Let us have a look at how it currently works.

    $ grep Rewrite /etc/apache2/sites-available/rewritetest
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteOptions inherit
    RewriteRule ^vhost /works [R=301,L]

    $ grep Rewrite .htaccess
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule ^htaccess /works [R=301,L]

    $ curl -I http://rewritetest/vhost
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    Server: Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu)

    $ curl -I http://rewritetest/htaccess
    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    Server: Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu)
    Location: http://rewritetest/works

The rewrite rules in our vhost is completely disregarded while the `.htaccess` works just fine. So the recommended [`RewriteOptions`](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewriteoptions) configuration does nothing.

Now let us see how to fix this, by adding the `RewriteOptions` configuration to the `.htaccess` to have it inherit our rewrite rules.

    $ grep Rewrite .htaccess
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteOptions inherit # Play nice, .htaccess!
    RewriteRule ^htaccess /works [R=301,L]

    $ curl -I http://rewritetest/htaccess
    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    Server: Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu)
    Location: http://rewritetest/works

    $ curl -I http://rewritetest/vhost
    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    Server: Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu)
    Location: http://rewritetest/works

Bam! Both configurations now work perfectly, side by side. This means we can keep the `.htaccess` pristine while being able to add our custom rewrite rules.

## Where is the patch?

So, when can we expect this in Drupal proper? As soon as I am able to convince [chx](https://twitter.com/chx) that *this is an excellent idea*. Feel free to [pitch in](http://drupal.org/node/1707998) if you agree!
