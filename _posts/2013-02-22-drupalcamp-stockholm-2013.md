Kind-of-annual event *DrupalCamp Stockholm* is about to kick off again, just two weeks from today. Mark your calendars — March 8th will bring a lot of geeky fun to our capital city.

There are some really promising sessions planned for this DrupalCamp. I am especially looking forward to [Fredrik Jonsson's](https://twitter.com/frjo_xdeb) talk on [Git](/git/) and [Fabian Sörqvist's](https://twitter.com/fabsor_) talk on Jaegirmeister. As always there are some conflicting sessions where I would love to see two talks but they are at the same time, like [Ida Franceen's](https://twitter.com/kolombiken) talk on kodsmuts which clashes with my own presentation.

I will present a talk on [Symfony](/symfony/), from the perspective of a [Drupal](/drupal/) developer. If Dependency Injection, Mediators, HTTP abstraction and code decoupling ticks your boxes — this is the talk for you!

Tickets generally sell fast the last couple of days, so be sure to [visit the site](http://spring2013.drupalcamp.se/) and get yours right away. At 295 SEK for the entire DrupalCamp, including lunch and wraps for dinner, this is a bargain!

See you there?
