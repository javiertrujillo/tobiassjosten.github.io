In September 2009 I founded a hot new web agency together with my friend [Viktor Miranda](http://viktormiranda.com/). Half a year later, in March 2010, we invited [Per Sandström](http://www.helloper.com/) to enforce our team. We called ourself [Kollegorna](http://www.kollegorna.se/) and we were engulfed in a burning passion to craft beautiful web.

Over the course of the last two years we have built some really great sites and had a lot of fun doing it. There are too many understanding clients, helpful freelancers and great colleagues I would like to thank for this time. It has been a blast!

That is the positive side of it. The negative side is something [Tomas de Souza](http://twitter.com/souza) described [so very spot on](http://blogs.goodold.se/loveaffair/2011/04/06/not-tonight-honey/) (in swedish). It is about working every awaken hour of the day and always feel this constant stress, like you are always on the verge of drowning.

Developing eventually became a chore for me, "spare time" turned into a bad joke and I started perceiving my fellow peer developers as competitors. Not very admirable but there you have it. Basically it stopped being the fun I love it for.

I know people who have lived like this for too long and it is not a pretty sight when they inevitably crash and burn. A few have managed to cope with it and are able to still lead a healthy life. I admire that but realize too well I am not able to myself. I get way too involved.

For that reason I am leaving Kollegorna. It has been an amazing time of my life and I am grateful for the friends I have made in Viktor and Per. We part on the best of terms and will hopefully continue to do fun stuff together for many more years.
