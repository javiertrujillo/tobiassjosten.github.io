I spend a lot of time in my terminal; with tools like [Vim](/vim/) and [tmux](/tmux/). It is my honest opinion that a proficient use of CLI will beat its GUI counterpart by orders of magnitude.

Which is why I recently switched from [Bash](/bash/) to [the Z Shell](http://www.zsh.org/); Zsh.

I have been eyeing it for a while and so when I read that a friend of mine had [switched to zsh](http://johndahlstrom.se/blog/2013/02/26/fem-saker-jag-gillar-med-zsh/), I felt it was good time to do so myself.

## Zsh on Ubuntu

If you are on Ubuntu and want to try Zsh out yourself, it could not be easier. First install it through Apt.

    $ sudo aptitude install zsh

Now just run `zsh` and you will jump right into the new shell. I suggest trying to tab complete something, for an instantaneous gratification.

To make Zsh your default shell, use `chsh`. Remember to re-login for the change to take effect.

    $ chsh -s $(which zsh)

## Find your current shell

If you want to know what shell you are currently on, try running `echo $0`. Looking at `/etc/passwd` will let you know what shell is configured for your account but again, changes there only kicks in next time you log in.

    % echo $0
    -zsh

Officially hipsterized!
