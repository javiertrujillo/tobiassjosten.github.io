[jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/), an excellent framework for mobile site development, has just released its [alpha 3 version](http://jquerymobile.com/2011/02/jquery-mobile-alpha-3-released/). There has been many improvements, with focus on snappier experience and more flexible usage.

One of the key features I am excited about is the new *AJAX navigation* which has been heavily revamped. I have not been able to test it out yet but I really hope this solves the problem with pages stacking on top of eachother when you clicked navigation links too fast in succession.

[John Resig](http://ejohn.org/), lead developer of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), writes that the development now continues to focus on a beta release before releasing a stable 1.0 release.
