[Greenpeace](http://www.greenpeace.org/) recently put up a parody campaign site to highlight the damages on rain forest caused by the oil palm plantations of *Neste Oil*. The oil company retaliated by suing Greenpeace's domain registrar, *Loopia*, for copyright infringement.

Crazy and lame, I know…

But what is really insane is how Loopia just folded to Neste Oil. They [shut down](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dn.se%2Fnyheter%2Fsverige%2Fstangd-parodisajt-efter-stamning) the environmental campaign site without any court ruling what so ever. A cowardly decision to censor their own customer.

This made me upset and so I went looking for more stories on Loopia, to see if this was a habit. Turns out it is a recent fad of theirs.

In 2007 a right wing extremist site was born in Sweden, with the purpose of [building a register](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dn.se%2Fkultur-noje%2Fdebatt-essa%2Fjudeforfoljelser-pa-internet) of swedish jews and communists. Guess which free-speech loving domain registrar got the nazis covered on the DNS department? Yes, Loopia! For some reason however the site got to stay open that time.

I do not want to support a supplier like that and so I will take [Pelle Wessman's](https://twitter.com/voxpelli) words to heart and [vote with my money](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fvoxpelli.com%2F2010%2F09%2Fdu-rstar-inte-bara-p-valdagen%2F). Currently I have 57 domains with Loopia and at around 100 SEK per year and domain, this sums up to roughly €635 in annual fees. Which they will no longer receive.

Perhaps not a lot for Loopia, but for me it is. And by doing this I get to tell them **this is not alright**. Not by far.
