Following up on [last years retrospective](/personal/2011-retrospective/) I thought it would be fun and useful to mull over what has passed and look ahead on what is yet to come. This year however I will deviate from the scrum sprint retrospective framework.

Forgive the egocentricity and please tag along for *my highlights of 2012*!

## What stands out from the year?

I try to learn a new major technology each year and for 2012 this happened to become [Haskell](/haskell/). I was reading the book Seven Languages In Seven Weeks when I came across the programming language. There and then I fell in love â€” truly a beautiful language!

[This blog](/blog/) is not the only place where I publish my writing. I have written for printed magazines before too and in 2012 two of my articles were published in [the New Relic blog](http://blog.newrelic.com/).

Following an amazingly awesome vacation in Vietnam and Cambodia I was horrified to see the resulting beach photos of myself. Shortly thereafter I was weighing my food, hitting the gym and grinding the tracks. Eight months later and 15 kilo less, I am still hooked and glad to have made this my new lifestyle.

Professionally I took another big leap when [I left my nice gig](/personal/off-to-new-adventures/) (and wonderful colleagues!) at Unibet. Since September I have been living life as a "*web entrepreneur*", where I build my own products and services, hoping to make a living from them sometime.

I attended [Symfony Live](/symfony/symfony-live-2012-paris/) in Paris, where I learned a lot about [my favorite web framework](/symfony/) and met a bunch of cool people. The latter [Music Hack Day](/events/music-hack-day-reykjavik-2012/) in Iceland was also really inspirational.

As I began working out more seriously I also started blogging about my [training and vegetarian nutrition](http://vvv.vegout.se/). When I later on shifted gears towards fighting I branched out to a [Mixed Martial Arts blog](http://vvv.tvekamp.se/). My post-consulting life gave rise to a third, [business and entreprenur blog](http://interversum.se/) and I have a fifth upcoming [travelling blog](http://vvv.vagabonden.se/). Writing is just really fun!

In November I was asked to [mentor a group of students](/events/mentoring-at-hyper-island/) at [Hyper Island](http://www.hyperisland.com/). I had a lot of fun bouncing ideas with them and get see their projects coming to life.

My startup project for [tracking tv-series](http://www.smartburk.se/) finally went beta!

## Resolutions for 2013

I do not like making new year resolutions but I do think it is important to keep planning ones future. In that spirit; here is what I want from 2013.

Keep controlling my own time, deciding for myself when I want to wake up, when I want to work long days and when I just want to stay home and play video games.

Together with my brother in arms, [Viktor Miranda](http://www.viktormiranda.com/), I will make sure the [tv-series site Smartburk.se](http://www.smartburk.se/) will have a sharp release.

Instead of working solely with development and technology I want to keep doing business, product development, search engine optimization, content creation and all other "soft areas" around Internet ventures.

I would love for my other blogs to have the same kind of traffic as tobiassjosten.net does but starting with getting above 100 daily visitors feels like a realistic step towards that.

Doubtlessly I will keep working out but I would also like to go at least one Muay Thai fight and two Jujitsu fights. I will need ten times (!) that before I am allowed to go a Mixed Martial Arts fight.

Now I am already looking forward to finishing this year and get cranking for the next. But first, some proper celebration. Happy new year, folks!
