title: Communities comparison for PHP frameworks

summary: The landscape of PHP is changing. We are witnessing a rapid evolution in framework architecture and there are a great many exceptional ones out there. Putting your time into learning one will doubtlessly pay off for many years ahead. But which should you pick?

The landscape of [PHP](http://php.net/) is changing. We are witnessing a rapid evolution in framework architecture and there are a great many exceptional ones out there. Putting your time into learning one will doubtlessly pay off for many years ahead. But which should you pick?

## Community

There are many factors to consider but one of the most important ones, in my opinion, is the community. A technically inferior system can still be the better option, if it has a stronger community to keep it improving and helping its users solve their problems.

Just look at [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/). ;)

## Comparison

Measuring the community behind frameworks is not easy, because it is such a soft value. I decided to compare one part that is easier to enumerate - the number of developers following their respective codebase.

The frameworks I looked at was _Symfony_, _Lithium_, _CodeIgniter_, _CakePHP_, _Zend Framework_ and _Kohana_. There a hundreds more but I think this should cover the top ones.

Without further ado, here is the ordered list from top to bottom.

[Symfony](http://symfony.com/) (<https://github.com/symfony/symfony>)  
*2602* watchers, 683 forks

[CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/) (<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp>)  
*1382* watchers, 310 forks

[Zend Framework](http://zendframework.com/) (<https://github.com/zendframework/zf2>)  
*1161* watchers, 376 forks

[Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/) (<https://github.com/kohana/kohana>)  
*700* watchers, 118 forks

[CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/) (<https://bitbucket.org/ellislab/codeigniter-reactor>)  
*554* followers, 127 forks

[Lithium](http://lithify.me/) (<https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/lithium>)  
*176* watchers, 37 forks

*Symfony* (2602) comes out on top, well ahead of number two - *CakePHP* (1382). Third place goes to *Zend Framework* (1161). *Kohana* (700) comes in as number four, closely followed by *CodeIgniter* (554). In the far bottom we find *Lithium* (176).

## Summary

I invested in Symfony over a year ago and these numbers confirms that I played the right horse. There are still some excellent contenders of course but I feel that betting on Symfony is the wise thing to do. Looking at its community further cements this opinion.

What surprised me the most is that Lithium had such a low number. I have not been looking at it myself but I keep hearing great things about it. This could be because they have recently moved to GitHub but I could not find when that was. Perhaps [June 14th](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/lithium/wiki/_history)?

I also thought that CodeIgniter would place higher than it did, at least above Zend Framework. But maybe I am just jaded by how strong CI seems to be here in Sweden.

Did I miss any major frameworks? Does these numbers have another meaning to you? What matters in your choice of framework? Let me know by posting a comment!

*Update:* [@leafnode let me know](https://twitter.com/leafnode/status/95390576882622464) that only the "heavily-development version of Zend Framework" is hosted on GitHub.

*Update:* CodeIgniter [just announced](http://ellislab.com/blog/comments/ellislab_switches_to_git_moves_to_github) they have [moved to GitHub](https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter) as well.
