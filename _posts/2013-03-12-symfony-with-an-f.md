A symphony is an extended musical composition in Western classical music. At least if you would believe the Wikipedia definition. In my world however, it is a grievous typo for one of the world's most powerful web frameworks â€” [Symfony](/symfony/).

I can see how Wikipedia could make the mistake. It is definitely not uncommon for newcomers to get it wrong after just hearing Symfony pronounced. So let us correct the error.

## Sensio Framework

The reason for spelling with an F dates back to 2005, when [Fabien Potencier](http://fabien.potencier.org/) decided to open source the framework he had been creating within [Sensio Labs](http://sensiolabs.com/en). Then named *Sensio Framework*, Fabien wanted something that would fit with the `sf` prefixes used throughout the codebase.

In [the words of Fabien](http://forum.symfony-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=906&p=3618#p3674) himself:

>The first name was Sensio Framework (Sensio is my company). So, all classes were prefixed with sf... and as a lazy dev, I didn't want to rename my classes with another prefix, so I was looking for a name with a S and a F inside. When doing some brainstorming for a good name, symfony (with a F, not a PH) came up.

The rest is history.

Nowadays we use *Symfony2*, without the space, when talking about the current version. This helps when looking for posts and discussions on how to solve specific problems, without getting the old versions.
