Today I found, applied for and was invited to *Ingress*. Just a few hours of playing has already gotten me hooked and if you are frequenting this site, chances are you will like it too.

[Wikipedia describes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingress_%28game%29) Ingress as "a near-realtime augmented reality massively multiplayer online video game. NianticLabs at Google has created a very involved story and parallel world where two factions, the Resistance and the Enlightened, fight for power.

This introduction video below does a good job of setting the scene.

If it tickles your fancy, [head over to Ingress.com](http://www.ingress.com/) to request an invite and then [go download the game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticproject.ingress). Happy hacking!
