Yesterday Fabien [introduced](http://symfony.com/blog/developing-the-symfony-community) a service called [Sensio Connect](https://connect.sensiolabs.com/). It is a community platform unlike any I have seen before.

Rather than the old, tired concept of communities as forums, *Sensio Connect* is a tool to build your own systems on top of. It sports *OAuth2* authentication and so integration is dead simple.

## Components and platforms

I think it goes very well with the [Symfony2](/symfony) model. Instead of building one big, monolithic system you have a set of decoupled components. When used together they are more than thair sum.

This is especially interesting now that I am in the process of starting up a [Swedish Symfony community](http://www.symfony.se/). We will see how we can leverage this platform.

## Sensio Labs

If I am to mention one slightly negative thing it is the fact that it is not called *Symfony Connect*. Lately we have seen projects like [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) and [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) move to the sensiolabs.org domain and this all feels very calculated to me.

Of course [Sensio](http://sensiolabs.com/) want to increase their visibility - it consequently increases their business and the money they make. And I really think they are worth every cent and more so.

Though it still leaves a sour taste in my mouth. But maybe I am too idealistic when it comes to open source. Or maybe it comes from my bad experience with mixing in too much business, from other open source projects.

## All in all

To sum it up I think this is a very exciting project and I will watch its outcome closely. I am certain we will see some interesting projects spring up around this. Like we have already seen [Symfony2 Bundles](http://symfony2bundles.org/) being enabled by the GitHub platform.

I have never heard of another open source community having done something similar, in which case this is extra awesome. But maybe I have just missed it?
