I have been known to call them the scourge of our Internet — the abhorrent *Made For Ads (MFA) sites*. They soil what could be an ever greater world wide web, only to make a few bucks for their talentless creators.

But do not get mad — get even, right? One way to help decrease their population is with [the Webspam Report](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-webspam-report-by/efinmbicabejjhjafeidhfbojhnfiepj) extension for Google Chrome. Reporting these sites helps Google find and deal with them more easily.

Install the extension and you will see a red flag next to the address bar. Then whenever you stumble upon one of these shady sites, just click the flag and write a comment how it violates [the Webmaster Guidelines](https://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35769).

Now get clicking. One report a day keeps the spammers at bay!
