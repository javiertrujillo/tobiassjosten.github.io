I recently pushed the initial commit for a new project of mine. Say hello to [Chaps](https://github.com/tobiassjosten/chaps)!

Chaps is a *command line tool* that will let you *manage your many lists of followers* on the various social networks out there. I will use it myself to find new, potentially interesting, people to follow on Twitter and to trim my following list on GitHub a bit.

To be honest though, it's not that much to see yet.

I decided to use [readme driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) for Chaps and so this first deliverable is nothing more than [a README](https://github.com/tobiassjosten/chaps/blob/master/README.md). Of course a lot of thought has been put into constructing that README but still, you can't actually use it yet.

## Now, your turn

I'm hoping you, dear reader, will help me next.

If this sounds like a useful tool to you then please [head on over to the project](https://github.com/tobiassjosten/chaps) and read up on it. Then please let me know what you're thinking! Does something look weird? Are you missing anything or do you notice something obsolete?

Leave a comment below or create [create an issue](https://github.com/tobiassjosten/chaps/issues/new) in the project to share your thoughts. Thanks!
