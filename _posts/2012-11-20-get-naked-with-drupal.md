I am a big fan of [CSS Naked Day](/css-naked-day/) and have been participating myself the last two occasions. Earlier this year I [open sourced a JavaScript project](/javascript/introducing-cssnakedday-js/) that on April 9th strips away your CSS entirely from the browser.

That covers the bases for us [Jekyll](/jekyll/) and other static site generator users. Since I am an old time Drupal developer it was only natural to port this library there, in the form of a module.

Please say hello to [naked.module for Drupal 7](http://drupal.org/project/naked)!

Naked.module was originally developed by [Brent Hardinge](http://brenthardinge.net/). With feedback from [Neftal√≠ Guerrero](https://github.com/Nesta) I made a quick port to Drupal 7, removing a lot of complexity on the way by having the module only include [CSSNakedDay.js](https://github.com/tobiassjosten/CSSNakedDay.js).

So, will your Drupal site join us in celebrating the semantic web a few months from now?
