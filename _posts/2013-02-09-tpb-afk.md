Yesterday saw the release of *The Pirate Bay — Away From Keyboard*; a documentary about the world's largest and most resilient file sharing site.

I just finished watching it and I liked it a lot. It was nice getting to know the persons behind the names *Brokep*, *Anakata* and *TiAMO*. I especially enjoyed listening to Peter Sunde and he definitely made it onto my list of cool people.

The documentary of course covers the trial against the three and The Pirate Bay. A farce. However, I feel that the documentary could have brought up more of the "irregularities" in the case and those involved.

If you are still not convinced, have a look at this trailer. Then go watch the full **TPB AFK** documentary either [streamed at YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTOKXCEwo_8) or downloadable [from the BitTorrent site itself](http://thepiratebay.se/search/tpb.afk/0/7/0).
