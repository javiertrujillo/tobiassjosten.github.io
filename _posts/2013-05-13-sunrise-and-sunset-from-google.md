Google seems to increasingly try and answer our more simple searches directly, rather than showing a list of websites that in turn might answer the search. It think it makes a lot of sense when it saves me time and clicks.

One such query I just bumped into is sunsets and sunrises. I wanted to know [what time the sun set in Stockholm](https://www.google.se/search?pws=0&q=sunset%20stockholm) and Google gave me the answer, right there in the SERP.

Of course they can also answer when the sun will rise again.

I have previously noted how Google also gives you [your public IP address](https://twitter.com/tobiassjosten/status/306738256517689345). What is your favorite example of these small Google widgets?

**Update:** [Aaron Axelsson](https://plus.google.com/u/0/118281915654680184791) told me about Google's own [Tips & Tricks page](https://www.google.com/insidesearch/tipstricks/all.html), where they list more of these kind of widgets. They have titled it "All Tips & Tricks" but it is missing, for example, the public IP one so I suspect there are more goodies out there.
