Google seems to increasingly try and answer our more simple searches directly, rather than showing a list of websites that in turn might answer the search. It think it makes a lot of sense when it saves me time and clicks.

One such query I just bumped into is sunsets and sunrises. I wanted to know [what time the sun set in Stockholm](https://www.google.se/search?pws=0&q=sunset%20stockholm) and Google gave me the answer, right there in the SERP.

Of course they can also answer when the sun will rise again.

I have previously noted how Google also gives you [your public IP address](https://twitter.com/tobiassjosten/status/306738256517689345). What is your favorite example of these small Google widgets?
