A week ago today I got up on stage at [DrupalCamp Stockholm 2013](/events/drupalcamp-stockholm-2013/) and held my first ever presentation. The topic was [Symfony](/symfony/) basics and the future of [PHP](/php/) and [Drupal](/drupal/).

It was absolutely nerve racking but also really, really fun! I definitely got a taste for presenting and I hope to do it soon again.

If you happened to miss the *Symfony Intro* presentation, my good friend [Viktor Miranda](http://viktormiranda.se/) recorded the entire session (thanks, mate!) and I just [finished uploading it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUmCeN4X9Ec). Put your Swedish on and hit play below.

The slides are [available online](http://tobiassjosten.github.com/symfony-intro/).

Getting up on stage before [all these people](https://twitter.com/frico74/status/309974180068204544) scared the shit out of me. So big thanks to all who helped me prepare! [Viktor](http://www.viktormiranda.com/), [Andreas](https://twitter.com/elmertoft), [Mia](https://twitter.com/miajung), [Daniel](https://twitter.com/dkvk), Samuel, [Per](http://www.helloper.com/) and Anna — much appreciated.

Hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did!
