*REST* is an abbreviation for *Representational State Transfer* and is an architecture style for network-based software. It was defined by Roy T. Fielding, one of the principal authors of HTTP, in his [doctoral dissertation](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm).

Since its inception in 2000 it has gradually grown in popularity and today the REST architecture is widely renowned. A lot of modern APIs claim to implement REST but [the majority are in fact not RESTful](/development/your-api-is-not-restful).
