Reading short posts online and applying that yourself is a great way to get started with new technology. But sooner or later you will come to a point where you need something deeper to keep improving your skills.

That is when I sit down to educate myself with a book. I try to do that as often as possible and over the years I have managed quite a few.

Here I will be gathering the top selection; all recommended books that I think you should consider reading. It is a great way to up your game!
