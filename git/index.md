Git is a free and open source, *distributed version control system* designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Every *Git* clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server. Branching and merging are fast and easy to do.

It's an awesome development tool.
