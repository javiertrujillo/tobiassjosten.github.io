Lua, meaning "moon" in Portuguese, is a powerful, fast, lightweight and embeddable scripting language. It combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics.

The Lua programming language was brought to the masses and made globally popular by games like World of Warcraft, where it is used for scripting within the game engine.
