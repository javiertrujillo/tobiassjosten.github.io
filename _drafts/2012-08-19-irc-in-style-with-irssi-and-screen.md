I have been on [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) since 1996. In fact it was through IRC that I initially got into programming, by wanting to extend the [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/) client.

Many late nights were spent flooding, nuking and exploiting. Shouts out to Kintar0, JaCkFr0sT, Martyr2, BrainPhreeze and the rest of *Clan X Scripterz*!

However, my interaction with *IRC* has changed quite a lot these last sixteen years. I do not take over nearly as many channels anymore and foreach iterations does not pose as big a challenge nowadays.
