Everything you are interacting with has an interface; whether it is a laptop touchpad, buttons on a touchscreen or even the handle of a hammer.

The quality of this interface determines the pleasure of the interaction. If it is good enough you will not even notice the interface but feel that you are directly connected with the object you are interacting with, willing it into submission.

This holds true for everything, including gaming, and it is the reason why I believe the most immersive way of gaming is on a [*MUD*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) â€” Multi User Dungeon.

## Simplicity

Here is an example of MUD gameplay.

    > kick vole
    You lift your leg, thrusting it at a red-backed vole.
    You connect!
    > look
    Nearing Unseelie Lane.
    A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. A mix
    of pine and ironwood branches form the catwalk here, held together with iron
    chains. The branches are slick with ice, as are the pine handrails. The vast
    wastes of Ithaqua are clearly visible from this vantage point, and the
    occasional howls of the ever-present dire wolves are barely audible. Just to the
    west lies Unseelie Court, with its hanging globular shops and wider catwalks.
    This has been marked as holy ground. An elite Warden lancer is manning a bolt
    thrower here. He has one-hundred and three bolts. Jaw hanging open in a snarl,
    a savage grey wolf paces here, padding softly back and forth. Mangled and
    bloodied fur is all that remains of a small red-backed vole.
    You see exits leading east and west.
    > get vole
    You pick up the corpse of a red-backed vole.

## Customization

In their simplest form you play MUDs on a black background with white characters scrolling by, completely devoid of graphics. A very nice feature of MUDs is that you connect to them using whatever telnet client you want. Of course developers throughout the decades has taken this to heart and there is a vast selection of MUD clients to pick from nowadays. Of course you can even write your own!
